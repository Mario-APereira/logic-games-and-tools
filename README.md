# Board/Logic Games & Tools

A collection of small projects exploring different programming paradigms and languages through games and tools.  
This repository includes board games implemented in **Python** and **Prolog**, as well as a **Kanban task manager written in C**.

The goal of this repository is to experiment with problem-solving approaches, game logic, and system-level programming across multiple paradigms.

## Projects Overview

### Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)
- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python
- Focuses on game logic, turn handling, and win-condition checks
- Suitable for CLI-based play or easy extension to a GUI

**Language:** Python  
**Paradigm:** Imperative / Procedural

---

### Nine Men's Morris (Python)
- Implementation of the traditional Nine Men's Morris board game
- Includes piece placement, movement, mill detection, and capture logic
- Designed with clear game-state management

**Language:** Python  
**Paradigm:** Imperative / Object-Oriented

---

### Kakuro (Prolog)
- Logic-based implementation of the Kakuro puzzle
- Uses constraints and logical rules to model and solve puzzles
- Demonstrates declarative problem-solving using Prolog

**Language:** Prolog  
**Paradigm:** Logic Programming

---

### Kanban Task Manager (C)
- Lightweight Kanban-style task manager written in C
- Supports basic task management and workflow organization
- Emphasizes low-level data structures and memory management

**Language:** C  
**Paradigm:** Procedural / Systems Programming

---

### Mining Spaceship (Assembly)
- Assembly program simulating a spaceship mining resources in space
- Demonstrates low-level programming, memory manipulation, and simple game logic
- Provides insight into registers, loops, and branching in Assembly

**Language:** Assembly
**Paradigm:** Low-Level / Procedural
